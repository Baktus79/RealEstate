# RealEstate

RealEstate is a spigot plugin built on top of GriefPrevention to provide players with an ability to sell, rent and lease claims to other players.

The plugin is documented in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/EtienneDx/RealEstate/wiki).

Please feel free to report any issue in the [GitHub Issue section](https://github.com/EtienneDx/RealEstate/issues).

## GriefPrevention

This plugin is dependent on GriefPrevention, which since version 1.3.0 will be included directly within the `RealEstate.jar` file.

The original GriefPrevention plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention). To make RealEstate possible, I had to implement some modifications to GriefPrevention, which I did in this [fork](https://github.com/EtienneDx/GriefPrevention).
